An introduction to Knowledge Representation can be found in (Ringland & Duce, 1989). (Brachman & Levesque, 1985) is a collection of papers discussing various aspects of Knowledge Representation, such as the difference between isa-links and instance-of-links in semantic networks. Papers about inheritance hierarchies can be found in (Lenzerini *et al.*, 1991). LOGIN is an extension of Prolog in which inheritance is represented by terms rather than clauses (A&iuml;t-Kaci & Nasr, 1986).
