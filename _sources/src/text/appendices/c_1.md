# A brief introduction to clausal logic #

```{solution} ex:1.2
```

There are six answers to this query:
```Prolog
{W→green_park}
{W→piccadilly_circus}
{W→leicester_square}
{W→bond_street}
{W→oxford_circus}
{W→tottenham_court_road}
```
The proof trees for the first three answers are analogous to {numref}`fig:1.2`. The proof tree for the fourth answer is given below (the two remaining proof trees are similar):
```{figure} /src/fig/appendices/image002.svg
---
width: 70%
name: 'fig:a.1'
---
```

```{solution} ex:1.4
```

The first specification can immediately be translated to Prolog:
```Prolog
list([]).
list([First|Rest]):-list(Rest).
```
A list of even length is either the empty list, or a non-empty list with two more elements than the next shorter list of even length:
```Prolog
evenlist([]).
evenlist([First,Second|Rest]):-evenlist(Rest).
```
In order to adapt this definition for lists of odd length, only the non-recursive clause needs to be changed:
```Prolog
oddlist([One]).
oddlist([First,Second|Rest]):-oddlist(Rest).
```
Notice that `oddlist` can also be defined in terms of `evenlist` (or *vice versa*):
```Prolog
oddlist([First|Rest]):-evenlist(Rest).
```

```{solution} ex:1.5
```

```Prolog
?-reachable(bond_street,piccadilly_circus,[S1,S2|Rest]).
```
