````{solution} ex:7.1
Redraw the parse tree of {numref}`fig:7.1` in the manner of an SLD proof tree, where 'resolvents' are partially parsed sentences such as
```Prolog
[the],[rapid],noun,verb_phrase
```
and 'clauses' are grammar rules.

<!--section 7.1-->
```{solution} ex:7.2
Draw the search space generated by the grammar in {numref}`sec:7.1` for a top-down parse, if grammar rules are applied to sentences from left to right. Discuss the similarities and differences with SLD-trees.
```

The search space is partly drawn below; the lower part, which contains all possible verb phrases, re-appears at three other nodes as indicated.

width: 70%
name: 'a.14'

```
This search space is basically a propositional SLD-tree, with fully parsed sentences corresponding to success branches (failure branches occur only when for some syntactic category no grammar rules are specified).

```{solution} ex:7.4
```

The transitive verb defines a binary mapping `Y=>X=>L`, which is applied to the meaning of the proper noun:
```Prolog
verb_phrase(M) --> transitive_verb(Y=>M),proper_noun(Y).
transitive_verb(Y=>X=>likes(X,Y)) --> [likes].
```
