````{solution} ex:8.1
Give the models of the program
```Prolog
bird(tweety).
ostrich(tweety).
flies(X):-bird(X),not abnormal(X).
abnormal(X):-ostrich(X).
```
(interpreting the general clause as the corresponding indefinite clause). Which one is the intended model (see {numref}`sec:2.4`)?
````

The models are
```Prolog
{bird(tweety),ostrich(tweety),abnormal(tweety)}
{bird(tweety),ostrich(tweety),abnormal(tweety),
 flies(tweety)}
```
i.e. Tweety, being an ostrich, is an abnormal bird which may or may not fly. The intended model is the first one, since we have no reason to assume that ostriches fly.

````{solution} ex:8.2
Give the models of the program
```Prolog
likes(peter,S):-student_of(S,peter).
student_of(paul,peter).
```
````

<!--Exercise 2.6-->
The Herbrand base of this program is
```Prolog
{likes(peter,peter),likes(peter,paul),
 likes(paul,peter),likes(paul,paul),
 student_of(peter,peter),student_of(peter,paul),
 student_of(paul,peter),student_of(paul,paul)}
```
The atoms `student_of(paul,peter)` and `likes(peter,paul)` are **true** in every model. If the atom `student_of(peter,peter)` is **true**, then so is the atom `likes(peter,peter)` (three possibilities). Disregarding the other four atoms, we obtain the following models:
```Prolog
{student_of(paul,peter),likes(peter,paul)}
{student_of(paul,peter),
 likes(peter,paul),likes(peter,peter)}
{student_of(paul,peter),student_of(peter,peter),
 likes(peter,paul),likes(peter,peter)}
```
Taking the four remaining atoms into account, we obtain $3*2^4=48$ models. (See also {numref}`ex:2.6`.)

````{solution} ex:8.3
Apply Predicate Completion to the program
```Prolog
wise(X):-not teacher(X).
teacher(peter):-wise(peter).
```
````

The completion of this program is

\begin{gather*}
\forall \texttt{X: wise(X)} \leftrightarrow \neg \texttt{teacher(X)} \\
\forall \texttt{X: teacher(X)} \leftrightarrow \texttt{(X=peter} \land \texttt{wise(peter))}
\end{gather*}

The first formula states that somebody is wise if and only if he is not a teacher; the second formula says that Peter is wise if and only if he is a teacher. Together, these two statements are inconsistent.
