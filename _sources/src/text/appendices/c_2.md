# Clausal logic and resolution: theoretical backgrounds #

```{solution} ex:2.1
Translate the following statements into clauses, using the atoms `person`, `sad` and `happy`:

<!--roman list-->
1. persons are happy or sad;
1. no person is both happy and sad;
1. sad persons are not happy;
1. non-happy persons are sad.
```

The statements should be read as '**if** &hellip; **then** &hellip;' statements. Thus, the first statement reads '**if** somebody is a person, **then** she is happy or sad':
```Prolog
happy;sad:-person
```
The second statement reads '**if** somebody is a person, **then** she is not both happy and sad'. In clausal logic, only positive conclusions can be drawn; negative conclusions are turned into positive conditions, as follows: '**if** somebody is a person, and she is happy and sad, **then** contradiction'. A contradictory conclusion is signalled by the empty head:
```Prolog
:-person,happy,sad
```
Following the same recipe, the third statement expresses that '**if** somebody is a person who is sad, and she is happy, **then** contradiction':
```Prolog
:-person,sad,happy
```
Thus, sentences 2 and 3 convey the same logical meaning.

+++

Finally, the fourth sentence reads '**if** somebody is a person who is not happy, **then** she is sad'. In clausal logic, only positive conditions can be used; therefore, this negative condition should be turned into a positive conclusion: '**if** somebody is a person, **then** she is sad or happy'. We thus obtain the same clause as in case 1:
```Prolog
sad;happy:-person
```

````{solution} ex:2.2
Given the program
```Prolog
married;bachelor:-man,adult.
man.
:-bachelor.
```
determine which of the following clauses are logical consequences of this program:

<!--roman list-->
1. `married:-adult`;
1. `married:-bachelor`;
1. `bachelor:-man`;
1. `bachelor:-bachelor`.
````

<!--roman list-->
1. Any model of the first clause, which additionally makes `man` **true**, is also a model of the clause `married;bachelor:-adult`. Likewise, any model of this clause which additionally makes `bachelor` **false** is also a model of the clause `married:-adult`, which is therefore a logical consequence of the program.
1. The body of this clause is **false** in any model of the program, and therefore the clause is **true** in any such model.
1. The body of this clause is **true** in any model of the program, while its head is **false**. The clause is therefore not a logical consequence of the program (on the contrary, it is **false** in every model of the program, not just in some).
1. This clause is a *tautology*: it is **true** in any interpretation, and therefore a logical consequence of any program.

+++

````{solution} ex:2.3
Write down the six Herbrand interpretations that are not models of the program
```Prolog
married;bachelor:-man,adult.
has_wife:-man,married.
```
````

The six interpretations are:
```Prolog
{man,adult}
{man,adult,has_wife}
{man,married}
{man,married,adult}
{man,married,bachelor}
{man,married,adult,bachelor}
```
The first two interpretations satisfy the body of the first clause but violate its head; the remaining four interpretations satisfy the body of the second clause but violate its head.

````{solution} ex:2.4
Give a derivation of `friendly` from the following program:
```Prolog
happy;friendly:-teacher.
friendly:-teacher,happy.
teacher;wise.
teacher:-wise.
```
````

This requires derivations of the clauses `friendly:-teacher` and `teacher`:
```{figure} /src/fig/appendices/image004.svg
---
width: 70%
name: 'fig:a.2'
---
```
Notice that this derivation can not be recast in the form of a linear tree, where each resolvent is obtained from the previous resolvent and a given clause, as in {numref}`Chapter %s<ch:1>`. This is due to the fact that some clauses are indefinite (have more than one positive literal).
<!--Chapter 1-->

+++

````{solution} ex:2.5
Prove by refutation that `friendly:-has_friends` is a logical consequence of the following clauses:
```Prolog
happy:-has_friends.
friendly:-happy.
```
````

The negation of `friendly:-has_friends` consists of two clauses, `:‑friendly` and `has_friends`. Together, these four clauses are inconsistent:

````{solution} ex:2.6
How many models does the following clause have over the Herbrand universe `{peter,maria}`:
```Prolog
likes(peter,S):-student_of(S,peter)
```
````

The set of ground instances of this clause is
```Prolog
{likes(peter,maria):-student_of(maria,peter),
 likes(peter,peter):-student_of(peter,peter)}
```
and the Herbrand base is
```Prolog
{likes(peter,peter),likes(peter,maria),
 likes(maria,peter),likes(maria,maria),
 student_of(peter,peter),student_of(peter,maria),
 student_of(maria,peter),student_of(maria,maria)}
```
Only the left four ground atoms are relevant for determining whether an interpretation is a model. 9 out of 16 truth-value assignments to these ground atoms result in a model. Because of the 4 irrelevant ground atoms, this yields $9*2^4=144$ models. Notice that this is a rather large number of models for such a modest Herbrand universe, and such a simple clause! This illustrates that *less knowledge leads to more models*.

+++

````{solution} ex:2.7
Write a clause expressing that Peter teaches all the first-year courses, and apply   resolution to this clause and the clause
```Prolog
likes(peter,maria):-follows(maria,C),teaches(peter,C)
```
````

This is expressed by the clause
```Prolog
teaches(peter,C):-first_year_course(C)
```
Resolution with the above clause yields
```Prolog
likes(peter,maria):-follows(maria,C),first_year_course(C)
```
In words: 'Peter likes Maria **if** Maria follows a first-year course'.

+++

```{solution} ex:2.9
Translate to clausal logic:

<!--roman list-->
1. every mouse has a tail;
1. somebody loves everybody;
1. every two numbers have a maximum.
```

<!--roman list-->
1. This statement should be read as '**if** *X* is a mouse, **then** there exists something which is *X*'s tail'. Giving *X*'s tail the abstract name `tail(X)`, we obtain the following clause:
   ```Prolog
   tail_of(tail(X),X):-mouse(X)
   ```
1. Here we need to give the person who loves everybody an abstract name. Since this person does not depend on anybody else, it can simply be a constant:
   ```Prolog
   loves(person_who_loves_everybody,X)
   ```
   Notice the difference with the statement 'everybody loves somebody':
   ```Prolog
   loves(X,person_loved_by(X))
   ```
1. This statement should be read as '**if** *X* and *Y* are numbers, then there exists a number which is their maximum'. Giving this maximum the abstract name `max(X,Y)` yields the clause
   ```Prolog
   maximum(X,Y,max(X,Y)):-number(X),number(Y)
   ```

+++

````{solution} ex:2.10
Determine the Herbrand universe of the following program:
```Prolog
length([],0).
length([X|Y],s(L)):-length(Y,L).
```
(Hint: recall that `[]` is a constant, and that `[X|Y]` is an alternative notation for the complex term `.(X,Y)` with binary functor '`.`'!)
````

In the intended interpretation, `s` is restricted to numbers and '`.`' is restricted to lists; however, variables are untyped in clausal logic, and the two sets of terms may be mixed. Thus, the Herbrand universe will contain terms denoting numbers, such as
```Prolog
0,s(0),s(s(0)),s(s(s(0))),…
```
and terms denoting lists of numbers, such as
```Prolog
[],[0],[s(0),0],[s(s(0)),s(0),0],…
```
but also 'strange' terms like
```Prolog
[[[0]]] or .(.(.(0,[]),[]),[])
[s(0)|0] or .(s(0),0)
[s([[]|0])]
```
and so on.

+++

```{solution} ex:2.11
If possible, unify the following pairs of terms:

<!--roman list-->
1. `plus(X,Y,s(Y))` and `plus(s(V),W,s(s(V)))`;
1. `length([X|Y],s(0))` and `length([V],V)`;
1. `larger(s(s(X)),X)` and `larger(V,s(V))`.
```

<!--roman list-->
1. `plus(s(V),s(V),s(s(V)))`.
1. `length([s(0)],s(0))`.
1. Not unifiable.

+++

```{solution} ex:2.13
Write a clause for the statement 'somebody is innocent unless proven guilty', and give its intended model (supposing that `john` is the only individual in the Herbrand universe).
```

The clause is
```Prolog
innocent(X):-not guilty(X)
```
with intended model `{innocent(john)}`.

+++

```{solution} ex:2.14
Translate to clausal logic:

<!--roman list-->
1. $\forall \texttt{X} \exists \texttt{Y: mouse(X)} \rightarrow \texttt{tail_of(Y,X)}$;
1. $\forall \texttt{X} \exists \texttt{Y: loves(X,Y)} \land \texttt{(} \forall \texttt{Z: loves(Y,Z))}$;
1. $\forall \texttt{X} \forall \texttt{Y} \exists \texttt{Z: number(X)} \land \texttt{number(Y)} \rightarrow \texttt{maximum(X,Y,Z)}$.
```

<!--Exercise 2.9-->
<!--roman list-->
1. This statement translates almost immediately into a clause, replacing the existential quantifier by a Skolem functor `tail`:
   ```Prolog
   tail_of(tail(X),X):-mouse(X)
   ```
1. This formula is already in conjunctive normal form, and each conjunct yields a separate clause. After replacing the existential quantifier by a Skolem functor `person_loved_by`, we obtain
   ```Prolog
   loves(X,person_loved_by(X)).
   loves(person_loved_by(X),Z).
   ```
   Notice that the two clauses are 'linked' by the Skolem functor.
1. Here, the Skolem functor has two arguments:
   ```Prolog
   maximum(X,Y,max(X,Y)):-number(X),number(Y)
   ```
   See also {numref}`ex:2.9`.
