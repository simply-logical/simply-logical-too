````{solution} ex:9.3
Determine the $\theta$-LGG of the following two clauses:
```Prolog
reverse([2,1],[3],[1,2,3]):-reverse([1],[2,3],[1,2,3])
reverse([a],[],[a]):-reverse([],[a],[a])
```
````

<!--Exercise 9.4-->
<!--section 3.6 sections 9.2 9.3-->
```Prolog
reverse([H|T],A,[RH|RT]):-reverse(T,[H|A],[RH|RT])
```
This is the recursive clause in the version with accumulator of the `reverse/3` predicate ({numref}`sec:3.6`), with one small difference: here, the third argument is required to be a non-empty list (which it always is). Notice that this clause is not strictly constrained, and cannot be inferred by the induction programs in {numref}`Sections %s<sec:9.2>` and {numref}`%s<sec:9.3>` (see also {numref}`ex:9.4`).
