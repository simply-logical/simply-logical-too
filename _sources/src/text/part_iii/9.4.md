The program `induce_rlgg/2` is based on the GOLEM system described in (Muggleton & Feng, 1990). The program `induce_spec/2` is based on the MIS system described in (Shapiro, 1983). (Quinlan, 1990) discusses a hill-climbing heuristic for top-down induction. The notion of generalisation in logic programs is discussed in (Niblett, 1988). (Gottlob, 1987) precisely characterises the difference between $\theta$-subsumption and logical consequence.

The subject of inductively inferring logic programs has been recently named *Inductive Logic Programming*. (Muggleton, 1992) is the first collection of papers on this subject. Recent books are (De Raedt, 1992) and (Lavra&#269; & D&#382;eroski, 1994).
